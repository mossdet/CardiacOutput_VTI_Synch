### These scripts analyze and compare data collected using two different biomedical devices: a Monitor and a Wearable device

The data was acquired duirng a Lower Body Negative Pressure Chamber (LBNP) Paradigm:

Data acquisition properties:
- Wearable data recorded in a discontinuous manner with nonlinear sampling rate: time stamps correspond to detected start time of a beat.
- Common metric between 2 datasets: Heart rate (HR)
- Metrics to compare: Cardiac output (CO) and Velocity time integral (VTI)
